    <h1>How do you define Nature?</h1>
    <p>
        According to The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 
        nature is “a creative and controlling force in 
        the universe,” “the external world in its 
        entirety” or “humankind’s original condition.” 
        The New Oxford American Dictionary describes 
        nature as “the phenomena of the physical world 
        collectively, including plants, animals, the 
        landscape, and other features and products of 
        the earth, as opposed to humans or human 
        creations”; “the basic or inherent features 
        of something, especially when seen as 
        characteristic of it”; or “the innate or 
        essential qualities or character of a person 
        or animal.”
